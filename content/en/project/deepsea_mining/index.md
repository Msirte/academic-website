This is an ongoing project. This page is just for showing the preliminary results and will be updated in the future.  
  
We are developing advanced underwater optical image processing algorithms, including 3D reconstruction algorithms for gated laser camera, stereo vision reconstruction algorithms incorporating water optical properties, and multi-channel line-scan laser 3D reconstruction techniques. These algorithms are designed to operate efficiently in scattering-dominated underwater environments, offering robust image denoising capabilities and accurate 3D inversion and reconstruction. The system significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast of 2D images while improving the range resolution of 3D imaging, thereby providing strong technical support for deep-sea mineral exploration.
