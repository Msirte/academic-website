abstract: A smart vector-inspired optical vision guiding (VIOVG) method for
  autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking and formation is proposed. Unlike
  traditional optical guiding methods based on LED arrays, the method is
  inspired by a vector, and uses four laser diodes to form a wing-light pattern
  to realize smart optical guiding for AUVs. Due to the light scattering effect
  from water, the four laser diodes can emit four bright and slim laser beams in
  water, which can be captured by underwater cameras. The intersections of the
  laser beams form wing-lights as markers for AUV distance and pose estimation.
  The wing-light pattern is easily tuned and extended by changing the
  propagation direction and the power of the laser beams beyond the limitation
  of the physical size of the AUV or docking station. The simulations and
  experiments show that the proposed method can achieve high precision
  positioning. A relative distance error of 3.35% is achieved in a positioning
  experiment at âˆ¼10 m. It has great potential for AUV docking and formation,
  especially for small AUVs.
