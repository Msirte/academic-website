  abstract = {Underwater range gated imaging (RGI) technique has been widely studied since it can well suppress scattering noise from water. The range intensity profile (RIP) plays a vital role in the image quality and range accuracy of underwater 2D and 3D RGI. The existing theoretical analysis for underwater RIPs mainly considers the attenuation effect of water on light propagation. However, it does not take into account the water scattering effect, and thus cannot fully reveal the characteristics of RIPs in underwater RGI. This paper has proposed a RIP analysis method for underwater RGI based on Monte Carlo method. The simulation results show that the water scattering significantly affects the properties of RIP, making it broadening and smoothing. The proposed method and conclusion will contribute to the design of underwater RGI systems, as well as optimizing their operating parameters.},
