abstract: We simulate boron on Pb (110) surface by using ab initio evolutionary methodology. Interestingly, the two-dimensional (2D) Dirac Pmmn boron can be formed because of good lattice matching. Unexpectedly, by increasing the thickness of 2D boron, a three-bonded graphene-like structure (P21=c boron) was revealed to possess double anisotropic Dirac cones. It is 20 meV/atom lower in energy than the Pmmn structure, indicating the most stable 2D boron with particular Dirac cones. The puckered structure of P21=c boron results in the peculiar Dirac cones, as well as substantial mechanical anisotropy. The calculated Young's modulus is 320 GPaÂ·nm along zigzag direction, which is comparable with graphene.
